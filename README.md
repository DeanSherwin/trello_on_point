# *Trello*:tm: On Point :point_up:
by [Dean Sherwin](https://www.deansherwin.com)  

A Google Chrome extension for measuring Trello cards' complexity/difficulty on a point score basis. By adding a point score (1 being low) at the beginning of a card's title in square brackets you can easily measure your task burndown and gauge team performance. List totals are displayed at the top of each list. Moving a card from on list to another will update both lists' totals.
